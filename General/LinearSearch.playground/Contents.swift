 // Linear search - Find wether number exist in array or not and give that number index back
    
 // The goal of the linear search algorithm is to find a particular value in an array.

 // Given an array of generic objects, you iterate through the array and compare each object to the object youâ€™re looking for. If the two objects are equal, stop and return the current index. If not, continue to look for the next object as long as there are objects left to compare.
