\f0\b Password Creation :
\f1\b0 \
\
A Password Manager wants to create new passwords using two strings given by the user, then combined to create a harder-to-guess combination. Given two strings, interleave the characters of the strings to create a new string. Beginning with an empty string,alternatively append a character from string a and from string b. If one of the strings is exhausted before the other, append the remaining letters from the other string all at once. The result is the new password.\
\
Ex : a = \'91hackerrank\'92   b = \'91mountain\'92. The result is hmaocuknetrariannk\

\
A sales executive needs to simplify an assigned sales task. The task is to sell the items given to her in a bag, where each item has an ID number.It is easier to sell items with the same ID numbers.the sales executive also decides to remove some items from the bag.The largest number of items that she can remove is also known to her.Fine the minimum number of different IDs allowed number of items.\
\
For example, she starts with a bag that contains the following n=6 items : ids = [1,1,1,2,2,3] and she can remove m=2 items.If she removes 2 of item 1, she will still have items of all three types.She could remove 2 of item 2, and have ids = [1,1,1,3] with 2 discrete item types or remove 1 each of types 2 and 3 leaving ids = [1,1,1,2]. Either way there are 2 item types left.\
